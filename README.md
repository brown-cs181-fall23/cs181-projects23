# exploreinformatics

This is a Bioinformatics project for CSCI1810 at Brown University. There are currently two components: Data_Vis and Motif_HMM. Each component has its own directory and a corresponding `assignment.md` that details the component outline and what students are expected to do in each step.

Potentially, a mini-component regarding phylogentic trees and the package MEGA will be developed.
