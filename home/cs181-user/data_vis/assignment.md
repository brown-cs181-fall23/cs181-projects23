# Explore Visualization - RNA Sequencing and ChIP-Sequencing

An interactive bioinformatics data visualization project that involves analyzing RNA-seq and  ChIP-Seq data using existing packages like ChIpSeeker, DESeq2, and GProfiler. The goal is for students to extract insights from the data, draw conclusions about proteins, and defend their findings using visualizations. This can be performed on a specific protein where we have control data, protein-knockout data.
